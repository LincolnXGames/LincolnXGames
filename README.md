### 👋 Hi! I'm LincolnXGames! (preferrably LincolnX)

#### Things I do in my free time are:
- 🔣 Coding
- 🕹️ Games
- 🖼️ Drawing/Sketching

#### ❓ What are you good at?
- 🎛️ Probably player accessibility. I like to think in the mind of a new player: What would they do? Will they know how to control the game? etc.

#### ❓ How & When did you start coding?
- 🔣 My first ever coding was in the infamous program, [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), when I was about 7 years old. Though being very simple, it has lots of potential, and I still use it to this day. Now, I also code in Javascript, Lua, and a bit of Python. (I Mainly use it for scratchattach, though.)

#### ❓ What do you want to do in the future?
- 🎮 I want to become a professional game developer!
